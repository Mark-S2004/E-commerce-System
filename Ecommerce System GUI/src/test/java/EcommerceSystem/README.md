# E-commerce System - System Testing

This directory contains unit tests for the E-commerce System GUI. These tests were developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach, ensuring that critical functionalities are thoroughly validated.
The unit tests in this directory focus on white-box testing.
This means that we examine the internal logic and code structure of the system to verify correctness.
By analyzing the code paths, we ensure that all branches, conditions, and edge cases are adequately tested.
[Code Coverage report in this link](https://ecommerce-junit-coverage-report.netlify.app/).

## Why the TDD approach?

- The unit tests here contribute to the overall robustness of the E-commerce System GUI. They catch defects early, preventing issues from propagating to other parts of the application.
- As the system evolves, changes can inadvertently introduce new bugs. These tests act as a safety net, preventing regression.
- The tests serve as living documentation. Developers can understand the expected behaviour of different components by examining the test cases.
